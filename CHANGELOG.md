## [3.0.1] — 2026-07-11

### Enterprise Readiness Cleanup (Phase 7.1–7.3) — **complete**

Major maintainability and multi-tenant scale pass after the security hardening sprint. Full notes: [docs/Security-Fortress.md](docs/Security-Fortress.md).

| Phase | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **7.1** | Prisma `getRlsDb` / `withRlsBypass` consistency; advisor metrics 90d window; owner summary SQL day buckets; batched image access; platform-operator-only national session; production weak-secret hard-fail; Zod JWT claim validation |
| **7.2** | Log/Sentry redaction; Sentry only on 5xx; rate-limit success→debug; request correlation IDs; Grok/Blob `reportMappedRouteError`; H12 behavioral tests (429, RLS contracts, session revoke, Clerk webhook) |
| **7.3** | Per-dealership IANA timezone + day-boundary/usage; `withStoryAiRoute` + `blockServiceAdvisorAi`; multi-group portfolio switcher; hot-path composite indexes |

**Status:** Engineering delivery for Phases **7.1–7.3 is complete.** Apply migration `20250716120000_apex_phase7_3_timezone_indexes` on production Supabase with Phase 6 RLS migrations + production KV.

### Security Hardening Sprint (Phase 6.1–6.5) — **complete and production-ready**

Enterprise multi-dealership security pass after third-party-style audit. **Code baseline for Phases 6.1–6.5 is complete and production-ready.** Full notes: [docs/Security-Fortress.md](docs/Security-Fortress.md).

| Phase | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **6.1** | Remove hard-coded owner secrets; create-only owner seed (no password overwrite); admin reset forces `mustChangePassword`; re-validate `ownerMayEnterDealership` on session rebuild; explicit platform operator allowlist (`APEX_PLATFORM_OWNER_EMAILS`) |
| **6.2** | Apex RLS default-deny (`app.rls_soft_open`); Technician / UsageLog / DealerGroupMembership RLS; control-plane `withRlsBypass`; Grok proxy short-lived HMAC tokens + timing-safe verify |
| **6.3** | Manager/admin auto dealership context + `getRlsDb`; allowlist-only audit metadata + `roNumberHash`; fail-closed `ro.list`; companion rate limits; production auth KV fallback warnings |
| **6.4** | Production KV setup docs + boot readiness logs; MFA/SSO + pen-test roadmap; pre-rollout complete gates |
| **6.5** | Apex production **fail-closed** without KV (503); MFA/SSO **implementation guidance**; final pre-rollout gates (no hard-coded credentials, RLS default-deny) |

**Migration note:** Phase 6.2 RLS policy on `DealerGroupMembership` must reference Postgres column `"technician_id"` (not camelCase `"technicianId"`) — corrected in `20250715120000_apex_phase6_2_rls_default_deny`.

**Production readiness:** ship with Vercel KV on Apex production, RLS + Phase 7.3 migrations applied, and pre-rollout **APEX 6.1–6.5** green.  
**Follow-on (product / ops, not code blockers):** deliver MFA/SSO features; independent pen test after production deploy.

### DealerGroup & group owner dashboard

- **PR-G1** — `DealerGroup` / `DealerGroupMembership` schema, VITI-AUTO seed, James Gray username owner (`viti.james.gray`).
- **PR-G2** — `scopeMode: group`, membership-filtered dealership list, enter/exit home session.
- **PR-G3** — Tier 1 portfolio metrics + rooftop comparison cards.
- **PR-G4** — Tier 2 trends (sparklines), certification rate, time-to-certify, AI usage, login health, staff depth.
- **PR-G5** — Tier 3 categorized attention flags, UX polish, `docs/Apex-DealerGroup-Owner-Dashboard.md`, pre-rollout **APEX DealerGroup** gate.
- Unit tests updated for group scope enums, owner username login, owner home routing, and group-scoped dealership API.

### Secure dealer provisioning (Apex multi-rooftop)

- **PR-P1** — `provisionDealer()` engine, CLI (`npm run provision-dealer`), templates, `must_change_password` migration, PII-free `dealer.provision` audit.
- **PR-P2** — Operator docs (`docs/Apex-Dealer-Onboarding.md`), forced password change UI gate.
- **PR-P3** — Opt-in `POST /api/owner/provision-dealer` behind `APEX_ALLOW_HTTP_PROVISION=true`.
- **PR-P4** — Integration tests (CLI + HTTP + password gate), `npm run smoke:dealer-provision`, pre-rollout **APEX Dealer Provision** gate.

### Security fortress & Apex platform (prior 3.0.x)

- Phase 6.0 Security Fortress complete (RLS, fail-closed audits, session revocation).
- Owner national scope + multi-rooftop login fixes for Apex mode.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-02

### Shop-floor release

- **Prompt v3.0.0** — veteran master-technician personas, anti-robotic tone, full 10-step warranty workflow (`THREE_C_GENERATION_RULES` + `SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
- **Diagnostic photos** — auto-save, preview, and delete for RO scan and Xentry diagnostic evidence.
- **Audit Story** — extended Grok scoring timeout (90s), route `maxDuration` 100s, stale-story toast on workflow errors.
- **Xentry cancel UX (L5)** — `cancelProcessing` clears pending diagnostic photo queue again.
- **Rebrand** — repository canonical URL `Nicequantum/Merlinus`; seed password no longer documented in README.
- **ESLint** — zero warnings: Next.js `Image` for photo grids; intentional hook-deps documented.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-02

### Pre-validation polish

- Updated **Technician Quick Start** and **Bay Reference Card** to match current UI labels (`Generate MI 4.3`, `Diagnostic Evidence`, `Audit Story`, certification flow).
- Added SVG wireframe screenshots in `docs/images/` for print-ready technician documentation.
- Pre-rollout validation now **separates code failures from configuration/env failures** in the summary report.
- Documented **Phase 1 accepted risks** (SSO/MFA, encryption key rotation) with compensating controls in source code.
- Expanded README with **Vercel KV setup** instructions for production rate limiting.
- Removed deprecated `filteredROs` export; public `/api/status` no longer exposes AI configuration.
- Xentry cancel clears pending diagnostic photo queue (parity with RO scan cancel).
- Low-priority audit items L1–L5 verified with unit tests and pre-rollout checks.

### Security & audit (from hardening cycle)

- Vision pipeline mutex, Xentry cancel/abort, diagnostics extract audit trail.
- PII tolerant reads with `piiDecryptWarnings` and client toast feedback.
- Xentry data model separation (RO vs line), audit metadata display in `AuditLogView`.
- `withAuth` uses session compliance versions without extra DB lookups.
